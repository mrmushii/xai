## 🌌 Overview

Xai is a premium intelligence layer designed to bridge the gap between complex datasets and human spatial intuition. By leveraging **3D Geometric Intelligence** and **Real-time Neural Synthesis**, Xai transforms abstract data streams into interactive 3D structures, allowing for multi-dimensional problem solving and deep context exploration.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### 🧠 AI Executive Summary
Powered by **Groq LPU** technology, Xai generates high-fidelity summaries of your data with sub-second latency. It doesn't just read; it understands context, sentiment, and long-term implications.

### 💠 Geometric Intelligence
Our bespoke 3D engine (built with **React Three Fiber**) visualizes knowledge as a living organism. Explore "Knowledge Trees" where nodes represent complex domains like Neural Networks, Robotics, and Ethics.

### 📊 Multi-dimensional Analytics
- **Sentiment Mapping**: Tone detection across 40+ languages.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time identification of structural outliers with high confidence scoring.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Algorithms that evolve based on your interaction patterns.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

Xai is built with a state-of-the-art stack focused on performance, aesthetics, and intelligence.

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript.
- **3D/Graphics**: Three.js, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`.
- **Motion/UX**: GSAP, Framer Motion for ultra-smooth transitions.
- **AI/Backend**: Groq SDK for ultra-fast inference, custom API routes for data ingestion.
- **Analytics**: Recharts for dynamic, interactive data visualization.
